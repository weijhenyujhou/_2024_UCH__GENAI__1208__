Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?


Take it easy with me, please  
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze  
Take your time, make it slow  
Andante, Andante  
Just let the feeling grow  
  
Make your fingers soft and light  
Let your body be the velvet of the night  
Touch my soul, you know how  
Andante, Andante  
Go slowly with me now  
  
I'm your music  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
I'm your song  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
Play me time and time again and make me strong  
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
  
There's a shimmer in your eyes  
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies  
Please don't talk, go on, play  
Andante, Andante  
And let me float away  
  
I'm your music  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
I'm your song  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
Play me time and time again and make me strong  
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me dow
